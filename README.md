**Complete 72 step plan in 10 phases(0-9) **
Phase 0: Strategic Planning & Core Concepts (Pre-Coding)
Part 1 of 72: Understand Your Initial Keywords - The Foundation of Discovery
•	a. Brainstorm Broad Categories: Start with very general terms related to your product (e.g., "surgical instruments," "dental equipment," "medical device manufacturers," "hospital supplies"). Think from the perspective of what a potential buyer or manufacturer in another country would call themselves.
•	b. Niche Down with Specificity: Once broad categories are identified, think of more specific terms. For "surgical instruments," this might be "forceps manufacturers," "scalpel suppliers," "surgical instrument exporters," "orthopedic instruments."
•	c. Consider Synonyms and Variations: Include common synonyms or variations (e.g., "equipments" vs. "equipment," "suppliers" vs. "vendors"). This broadens your initial search net.
•	Wisdom & Guidance: These initial keywords are critical. They define your initial target audience. Don't worry about perfection, you'll refine them later. Think like a global buyer!
Part 2 of 72: Define Your Global Reach Strategy
•	a. Start with Key Regions/Countries: While aiming for the whole world, it's practical to start with a few target regions or countries where you see immediate potential or have existing market knowledge (e.g., "Europe," "Middle East," "South America," or specific countries like "Germany," "UAE," "Brazil").
•	b. Research Localized Search Terms: For non-English speaking countries, consider if common search terms are different in their local languages (e.g., "Hersteller von chirurgischen Instrumenten" for German). This will be useful for more advanced scraping later.
•	c. Prioritize Based on Market Data (Optional but Pro): If you have any market research or trade data, use it to prioritize countries with high demand or fewer existing suppliers for your products.
•	Wisdom & Guidance: Covering the "whole world" is a big goal. Break it down. Focusing on a few regions first allows for better testing and learning before global scaling.
Part 3 of 72: Plan for Integrating Your Existing Data
•	a. Identify Your Data Source: Where is your existing company and country data stored? (e.g., CSV, Excel, Google Sheet, existing CRM).
•	b. Map Your Data Fields: Understand which columns in your existing data correspond to company_name, country, website, email, contact_name etc.
•	c. Decide on Integration Method: Will you manually import it as a one-time operation, or will the system regularly check for updates? For starters, a one-time import is simplest.
•	Wisdom & Guidance: Your existing data is a goldmine. Integrating it ensures you don't re-acquire information you already possess and can focus on net-new leads.
Part 4 of 72: Outline Your Database Schema - Now with Pro Additions
•	a. Review companies Table Schema: Ensure it includes: company_id, name, website, address, city, country, latitude, longitude, industry, initial_relevance_score, dynamic_lead_score (NEW), outreach_status (e.g., 'Not Contacted', 'Contacted', 'Responded', 'Interested', 'Do Not Contact', 'Converted'), source_data_origin (NEW: e.g., 'Scraped', 'User_Import').
•	b. Review contacts Table Schema: Confirm: contact_id, company_id (FK), name, email, phone, linkedin_profile, whatsapp_number, role, message_variant_tested (NEW for A/B testing).
•	c. Review campaigns Table Schema: Confirm: campaign_id, contact_id (FK), message_body, subject_line, channel, timestamp, status, sequence_step (NEW: e.g., 1, 2, 3 for follow-ups), sequence_rule_applied (NEW). Also consider ab_test_group (NEW for A/B testing).
•	Wisdom & Guidance: A well-designed database is the backbone. These new fields allow for dynamic lead scoring, A/B testing, and managing complex follow-up sequences.
Part 5 of 72: Outline Additional Pro Database Tables
•	a. ab_test_results Table (NEW):
o	Schema: test_id, campaign_id (FK), variant_name, metric (e.g., 'opens', 'clicks', 'replies'), value, timestamp. This stores performance data for each A/B test variant.
•	b. lead_nurturing_rules Table (NEW):
o	Schema: rule_id, trigger_event (e.g., 'no_reply_email_1', 'email_opened_no_click'), action_type (e.g., 'send_followup_2', 'linkedin_connect'), delay_days, next_message_template_id. This powers conditional follow-ups.
•	c. crm_sync_status Table (NEW):
o	Schema: record_type (e.g., 'company', 'contact', 'campaign'), record_id, crm_id, last_synced_at, sync_status (e.g., 'Pending', 'Synced', 'Error').
•	Wisdom & Guidance: These tables are crucial for implementing the advanced "pro" features like A/B testing and intelligent follow-ups. They formalize the logic of your outreach.
Phase 1: Initial System Setup & Environment
Part 6 of 72: Install Python 3.9+ (Re-affirmation)
•	a. Check Current Python Version: Open terminal/command prompt and type python --version or python3 --version.
•	b. Install if Needed: If not installed or older, download the latest 3.9+ version from python.org.
•	c. Verify Installation: Run the version check again.
•	Wisdom & Guidance: Always use a recent Python version for compatibility with modern libraries.
Part 7 of 72: Create and Activate Your Virtual Environment
•	a. Navigate to Project Root: cd path/to/your/export_outreach_system
•	b. Create Venv: python -m venv export_outreach_env
•	c. Activate Venv:
o	Linux/Mac: source export_outreach_env/bin/activate
o	Windows: export_outreach_env\Scripts\activate
•	Wisdom & Guidance: This isolates your project dependencies, preventing conflicts with other Python projects on your machine. Always activate it when working on the project.
Part 8 of 72: Install Core Python Dependencies
•	a. Install Web Scraping & Data Processing: pip install scrapy playwright pandas sqlite3 requests beautifulsoup4
•	b. Install Geospatial & Outreach Utilities: pip install folium geopy email-validator twilio flask
•	c. Install AI & ML Libraries: pip install ollama transformers torch
•	Wisdom & Guidance: pip install is your best friend. Install them step-by-step. If one fails, try to troubleshoot it before moving on.
Part 9 of 72: Set Up Playwright Browsers
•	a. Install Playwright Browsers: After pip install playwright, run: playwright install
•	b. Verify Installation: This command installs the necessary browser binaries (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) for Playwright to work.
•	c. Troubleshooting (if needed): If you encounter issues, check Playwright's documentation for specific system requirements.
•	Wisdom & Guidance: Playwright is crucial for scraping dynamic content (websites with JavaScript). Ensure its browsers are installed.
Part 10 of 72: Prepare Your Project Directory Structure
•	a. Create Top-Level Directory: mkdir export_outreach_system (if you haven't already).
•	b. Create Subdirectories: Inside export_outreach_system/, create:
o	config/
o	data/
o	scrapers/
o	ai_engine/
o	outreach/
o	compliance/
o	visualization/
o	crm_integration/ (NEW)
o	logs/ (NEW for error handling)
•	c. Place main.py and requirements.txt: Create these directly in export_outreach_system/.
•	Wisdom & Guidance: A well-organized project is easier to manage, debug, and scale. This structure keeps related code together.
Part 11 of 72: Basic requirements.txt Creation
•	a. Generate Initial List: While your virtual environment is active, run: pip freeze > requirements.txt
•	b. Review requirements.txt: Open the file and ensure it lists all the packages you just installed.
•	c. Update Regularly: Make a habit of running pip freeze > requirements.txt whenever you install new packages.
•	Wisdom & Guidance: This file allows anyone (or yourself in the future) to set up the exact same environment with pip install -r requirements.txt.
Phase 2: Database Initialization & Configuration
Part 12 of 72: Initialize the companies.db SQLite Database
•	a. Create data/db_schema.py: This file will contain your SQL table creation statements.
•	b. Write companies Table Creation SQL:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS companies (
    company_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    website TEXT,
    address TEXT,
    city TEXT,
    country TEXT,
    latitude REAL,
    longitude REAL,
    industry TEXT,
    initial_relevance_score REAL DEFAULT 0.0,
    dynamic_lead_score REAL DEFAULT 0.0,
    outreach_status TEXT DEFAULT 'Not Contacted',
    source_data_origin TEXT DEFAULT 'Scraped',
    last_outreach_date TEXT,
    next_followup_date TEXT
);


•	c. Write Python to Execute SQL: In data/db_init.py (or a similar script), import sqlite3 and write code to connect to data/companies.db and execute the CREATE TABLE statement.
•	Wisdom & Guidance: SQLite is perfect for local development – no server setup needed. The IF NOT EXISTS clause is important so you don't get errors if the table already exists.
Part 13 of 72: Initialize the contacts Table
•	a. Add contacts Schema to data/db_schema.py:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS contacts (
    contact_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,

    phone TEXT,
    linkedin_profile TEXT,
    whatsapp_number TEXT,
    role TEXT,
    message_variant_tested TEXT, -- For A/B testing
    FOREIGN KEY (company_id) REFERENCES companies(company_id)
);


•	b. Add contacts Creation to data/db_init.py: Ensure this table is created when the database is initialized.
•	c. Run db_init.py for First Time: Execute the script to create the database and tables.
•	Wisdom & Guidance: UNIQUE constraint on email is crucial to avoid duplicate contacts. FOREIGN KEY links contacts to companies.
Part 14 of 72: Initialize the campaigns Table
•	a. Add campaigns Schema to data/db_schema.py:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS campaigns (
    campaign_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    contact_id INTEGER,
    message_body TEXT,
    subject_line TEXT,
    channel TEXT,
    timestamp TEXT,
    status TEXT,
    sequence_step INTEGER DEFAULT 1, -- e.g., 1st email, 2nd follow-up
    sequence_rule_applied TEXT, -- e.g., 'no_reply_email_1'
    ab_test_group TEXT, -- For A/B testing
    FOREIGN KEY (contact_id) REFERENCES contacts(contact_id)
);


•	b. Add campaigns Creation to data/db_init.py: Include this in your database initialization script.
•	c. Verify Tables Exist: You can use a SQLite browser tool (like DB Browser for SQLite) to confirm all tables are created.
•	Wisdom & Guidance: This table tracks every outreach attempt, which is vital for monitoring and refining your strategy.
Part 15 of 72: Initialize rate_tracking & do_not_contact Tables
•	a. Add rate_tracking Schema:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS rate_tracking (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    channel TEXT NOT NULL, -- e.g., 'email', 'linkedin', 'whatsapp'
    date TEXT NOT NULL, -- YYYY-MM-DD
    count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    UNIQUE(channel, date) -- Ensure only one entry per channel per day
);


•	b. Add do_not_contact Schema:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS do_not_contact (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    contact_id INTEGER,
    email TEXT UNIQUE,
    linkedin_profile TEXT UNIQUE,
    reason TEXT,
    timestamp_added TEXT
);


•	c. Update db_init.py: Add creation statements for both tables.
•	Wisdom & Guidance: These are crucial for ethical and compliant outreach, preventing you from spamming or contacting unwilling recipients.
Part 16 of 72: Initialize Pro-Feature Database Tables
•	a. Add ab_test_results Schema:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ab_test_results (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    test_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    metric TEXT NOT NULL, -- e.g., 'opens', 'clicks', 'replies', 'positive_replies'
    value REAL,
    timestamp TEXT,
    UNIQUE(test_name, variant_name, metric, timestamp)
);


•	b. Add lead_nurturing_rules Schema:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS lead_nurturing_rules (
    rule_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    rule_name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    trigger_event TEXT NOT NULL, -- e.g., 'no_reply_email_1', 'email_opened_no_click'
    action_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- e.g., 'send_followup_email', 'linkedin_connect'
    delay_days INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    next_message_template_id TEXT, -- Reference to a message template for LLM
    priority INTEGER DEFAULT 1 -- For rule execution order
);


•	c. Add crm_sync_status Schema:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS crm_sync_status (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    record_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- e.g., 'company', 'contact', 'campaign'
    record_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    crm_id TEXT, -- ID from CRM system
    last_synced_at TEXT,
    sync_status TEXT, -- e.g., 'Pending', 'Synced', 'Error'
    error_message TEXT,
    UNIQUE(record_type, record_id)
);


•	Wisdom & Guidance: These tables enable dynamic follow-ups, A/B testing, and robust CRM integration. They are more advanced but make the system far more powerful.
Part 17 of 72: Configure config/settings.py (General)
•	a. Create settings.py: This file will hold all your system-wide configurations.
•	b. Define Database Path: DB_PATH = 'data/companies.db'
•	c. Define Log Path: LOG_PATH = 'logs/app.log'
•	d. Define Output Paths: MAP_OUTPUT_PATH = 'data/outreach_map.html'
•	Wisdom & Guidance: Centralizing settings makes your code cleaner and easier to modify.
Part 18 of 72: Configure config/settings.py (Scraping Parameters)
•	a. Scraping Delays: DOWNLOAD_DELAY = 2 (seconds per request), MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE = 20
•	b. User Agents: USER_AGENTS = ['Mozilla/5.0...', 'Chrome/...', 'Firefox/...'] (list of common browser user agents to rotate).
•	c. Proxy List Path: PROXY_LIST_PATH = 'config/proxies.txt' (you'll create this file later).
•	d. Initial Target Industries (Keywords): TARGET_INDUSTRIES = ["surgical instruments manufacturers", "medical device exporters"]
•	Wisdom & Guidance: These settings are crucial for ethical scraping and avoiding IP bans. Start with conservative delays, you can optimize later.
Part 19 of 72: Configure config/settings.py (AI Parameters)
•	a. LLM Model: LLM_MODEL_NAME = 'mistral:7b'
•	b. Ollama Server URL: OLLAMA_API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:11434/api'
•	c. Generation Parameters: LLM_TEMPERATURE = 0.7, LLM_MAX_TOKENS = 200
•	d. Message Templates Path: MESSAGE_TEMPLATES_PATH = 'config/message_templates.json' (NEW, for storing templates used by LLM).
•	Wisdom & Guidance: Temperature controls creativity (higher = more creative). Max tokens controls message length.
Part 20 of 72: Configure config/settings.py (Outreach & Compliance Parameters)
•	a. Email Settings: EMAIL_PROVIDER = 'smtp.gmail.com', EMAIL_PORT = 587, EMAIL_USERNAME = 'your_email@gmail.com', EMAIL_PASSWORD = 'your_app_password' (use app passwords!).
•	b. Daily Limits: DAILY_EMAIL_LIMIT = 50, DAILY_LINKEDIN_LIMIT = 20, DAILY_WHATSAPP_LIMIT = 10 (start low!).
•	c. Twilio Settings (for WhatsApp): TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = 'ACxxxxxx', TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = 'your_token', TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER = '+1234567890'
•	d. GDPR/CCPA Compliance Status: GDPR_COMPLIANCE_ENABLED = True
•	Wisdom & Guidance: Always use app-specific passwords for email accounts if available for security. Start with very low daily limits to test and avoid getting blocked.
Part 21 of 72: Set Up Centralized Logging (logs/ directory)
•	a. Create logs/ directory: Ensure this folder exists.
•	b. Implement Basic Logging in main.py:
import logging
from config import settings

logging.basicConfig(filename=settings.LOG_PATH, level=logging.INFO,
                    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.info("Application started.")


•	c. Extend Logging to Modules: Ensure other modules (scrapers, AI, outreach) use this logger to record their activities and errors.
•	Wisdom & Guidance: Logging is crucial for debugging and monitoring your system's health. You'll thank yourself later when something goes wrong.
Phase 3: Data Import & Initial Enrichment
Part 22 of 72: Prepare Your Existing Company Data for Import
•	a. Clean Your Existing Data: Ensure your company names, countries, and websites are as clean as possible (e.g., no extra spaces, consistent capitalization).
•	b. Standardize Country Names: Use a consistent format for country names (e.g., "United States" instead of "USA"). This is vital for global coverage and mapping.
•	c. Convert to CSV: If your data isn't already in CSV format, convert it. Make sure columns align with your companies and contacts table schemas (e.g., company_name, country, website, contact_email).
•	Wisdom & Guidance: "Garbage in, garbage out." The quality of your existing data directly impacts the quality of your outreach.
Part 23 of 72: Develop data/importer.py for Existing Company Data
•	a. Read CSV File: Use pandas to read your prepared CSV file.
•	b. Iterate and Insert into companies Table: For each row, check if the company already exists in your companies.db. If not, insert it. Set source_data_origin to 'User_Import'.
•	c. Handle Duplicates: If a company already exists, update its fields if necessary (e.g., add missing website, or ensure source_data_origin is 'User_Import' if you imported it).
•	Wisdom & Guidance: This script gets your existing knowledge into the system. It should be robust enough to handle partial data and avoid creating duplicates.
Part 24 of 72: Develop data/importer.py for Existing Contact Data
•	a. Read CSV File (Contacts): If you have a separate contact CSV, read it.
•	b. Link Contacts to Companies: For each contact, find its associated company_id from the companies table. If the company doesn't exist, create it first (this might happen if your contact CSV has companies not in your main company list).
•	c. Insert into contacts Table: Insert the contact data.
•	Wisdom & Guidance: Ensuring proper linking between contacts and companies is vital for personalized outreach.
Part 25 of 72: Initial Geocoding for Imported Data
•	a. Add Geocoding Logic to data/importer.py: For imported companies that have an address but no latitude and longitude, use geopy to get these coordinates.
•	b. Use a Geocoder Service: from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim; geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent="export-outreach-system") is a good starting point. Be mindful of usage limits.
•	c. Update companies Table: Store the latitude and longitude back into the database.
•	Wisdom & Guidance: Geocoding is slow. Run it as a batch process after import. It's essential for map visualization.
Part 26 of 72: Initial initial_relevance_score Calculation for Imported Data
•	a. Develop ai_engine/relevance_scorer.py: Create a function to calculate a basic initial_relevance_score.
•	b. Simple Rules for Initial Score: For now, it can be based on industry keywords matching TARGET_INDUSTRIES or if the country matches a high-priority country.
•	c. Apply to Imported Data: After import, run this scoring function on all newly imported companies and update their initial_relevance_score.
•	Wisdom & Guidance: This initial score helps your system immediately identify the more promising leads from your existing data for prioritized outreach.
Phase 4: Web Scraping - Global Company Discovery
Part 27 of 72: Identify Global Web Directories for Scraping
•	a. Generic Directories: Start with global or widely used directories like Yellow Pages (check different country versions), Yelp (global presence), ThomasNet (B2B specific).
•	b. Industry-Specific Directories: Search for "surgical instrument manufacturers directory [country name]" for more targeted results.
•	c. Localized Search: For target non-English speaking countries, use local Google searches (e.g., Google.de for Germany) with localized keywords to find local directories.
•	Wisdom & Guidance: Diversify your sources. Some directories are better for certain regions or industries.
Part 28 of 72: Develop scrapers/directory_spider.py (Core Logic)
•	a. Scrapy Spider Setup: Create a new Scrapy spider class within directory_spider.py.
•	b. Define start_urls: These will be the initial search URLs for your chosen directories. You'll dynamically build these later.
•	c. Parse Search Results: Write parsing logic (parse method) to extract company_name, website_url, address from the search result pages using XPath or CSS selectors.
•	Wisdom & Guidance: Scrapy is powerful for structured data extraction. Learn its basics (spiders, requests, parsers).
Part 29 of 72: Dynamic start_urls Generation for Global Reach
•	a. Country List: Maintain a list of target countries (e.g., in config/settings.py or a separate config/countries.py).
•	b. Keyword Combinations: Programmatically combine your TARGET_INDUSTRIES with each country name to generate specific search queries for directories (e.g., "surgical instruments manufacturers Germany Yellow Pages").
•	c. Construct URLs: Build the start_urls dynamically by inserting these combined keywords into the directory's search URL patterns.
•	Wisdom & Guidance: Automating URL generation is key for scaling globally.
Part 30 of 72: Implement Pagination Handling in directory_spider.py
•	a. Identify Next Page Link: Locate the XPath or CSS selector for the "next page" button or link on directory search results.
•	b. Follow Link Recursively: In your parse method, if a next page link exists, create a new scrapy.Request to that URL and call your parse method again (yield scrapy.Request(next_page_url, callback=self.parse)).
•	c. Termination Condition: Ensure your spider knows when to stop (e.g., no more next page links).
•	Wisdom & Guidance: Pagination is crucial for comprehensive scraping. Don't just get the first page of results.
Part 31 of 72: Initial Data Cleaning and Extraction in Spider
•	a. Clean Extracted Text: Remove extra whitespace, special characters, or HTML tags from extracted data.
•	b. Basic Validation: Check if extracted website_url is a valid URL format.
•	c. Pass Data to Pipeline: yield {'name': company_name, 'website': website_url, ...} to send data to a Scrapy pipeline.
•	Wisdom & Guidance: Clean data at the source as much as possible. It saves headaches later.
Part 32 of 72: Develop Scrapy Item Pipeline (scrapers/pipelines.py)
•	a. Create DatabasePipeline Class: This pipeline will receive data from your spiders.
•	b. Connect to Database: In the pipeline's open_spider method, establish a connection to data/companies.db.
•	c. Process Item (Insert/Update): In the process_item method, check if the company already exists (by name or website). If not, insert it into the companies table. If it exists, update relevant fields.
•	d. Close Database: In close_spider, close the database connection.
•	Wisdom & Guidance: Scrapy pipelines are designed for post-processing scraped data, like saving to a database.
Part 33 of 72: Implement compliance/rate_limiter.py for Scraping
•	a. Create RateLimiterMiddleware (Scrapy Middleware): This will be a custom middleware in Scrapy.
•	b. Track Requests Per Domain: Maintain a dictionary or a database table (rate_tracking could be extended) to log the time of each request to a specific domain.
•	c. Enforce Delay: Before sending a request, calculate if enough time has passed since the last request to that domain based on DOWNLOAD_DELAY and MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE. If not, delay the request.
•	Wisdom & Guidance: Respecting website's robots.txt and rate limits is ethical and prevents your IP from being banned.
Part 34 of 72: Implement compliance/proxy_rotator.py for Scraping
•	a. Create ProxyMiddleware (Scrapy Middleware): Another custom middleware.
•	b. Load Proxies: Read proxy URLs from config/proxies.txt (one proxy per line: http://user:pass@ip:port).
•	c. Rotate Proxies: Before each request, select a new proxy from your list and assign it to the request's meta['proxy'].
•	d. Proxy Testing (Advanced): Implement a background task to periodically test proxies for availability and speed, removing bad ones.
•	Wisdom & Guidance: Proxies are essential for large-scale, global scraping to avoid IP blocks and ensure geographical diversity of requests. You'll need to acquire reliable proxies.
Part 35 of 72: Develop scrapers/company_spider.py (Website Detail Scraper)
•	a. Scrapy Spider Setup: New spider specifically for individual company websites.
•	b. Get URLs from DB: This spider will get website URLs from your companies table where outreach_status is 'Not Contacted' or website details are missing.
•	c. Use Playwright: Integrate Playwright (scrapy_playwright library) for rendering JavaScript-heavy websites. This will be more robust than just requests or beautifulsoup4.
•	Wisdom & Guidance: Dynamic websites require a browser engine. Playwright is powerful for this.
Part 36 of 72: Extract Deeper Company Information
•	a. Navigate Key Pages: Instruct the spider to visit "About Us," "Contact Us," "Services/Products," "Careers" pages if found.
•	b. Extract industry & product_details: Look for more specific industry classifications or details about their products/services to refine the industry field in companies table.
•	c. Extract social_media_links: Find links to LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, etc., for further social scraping.
•	d. Extract contact_form_url: If a direct contact form exists.
•	Wisdom & Guidance: The more detailed information you have, the better your personalization can be.
Part 37 of 72: Extract Contact Information (Emails, Names, Roles)
•	a. Scrape Contact Pages: Prioritize "Contact Us" pages for emails and names.
•	b. Regex for Emails: Use regular expressions to find email addresses on the page.
•	c. Heuristic for Names/Roles: Attempt to extract names and roles near email addresses or from "Team" or "Leadership" sections. This is often challenging and requires robust heuristics.
•	d. Update contacts Table: Store extracted emails, names, and roles, linking to the company_id.
•	Wisdom & Guidance: Email extraction can be tricky. Be prepared for some manual verification or quality checks.
Part 38 of 72: Geocoding for Newly Scraped Data
•	a. Run Geocoding on New Companies: After scraping, any new companies with an address but no coordinates should be sent through the geocoding process (similar to Part 25).
•	b. Batch Processing: Automate this to run periodically on new companies entries.
•	Wisdom & Guidance: Keep your latitude and longitude fields updated for accurate visualization.
Phase 5: AI-Powered Personalization & Lead Scoring
Part 39 of 72: Set Up Ollama Local LLM Server
•	a. Download Ollama: Go to ollama.com and download the Ollama application for your operating system.
•	b. Install Ollama: Follow the installation instructions.
•	c. Pull LLM Model: Open your terminal and run: ollama pull mistral:7b (or your chosen model). This downloads the model locally.
•	d. Verify Ollama Server Running: Once installed, Ollama runs in the background. You can test it with ollama run mistral:7b "Hello world".
•	Wisdom & Guidance: Running LLMs locally saves costs and protects privacy. Ollama simplifies the process significantly.
Part 40 of 72: Develop ai_engine/local_llm.py API Wrapper
•	a. Create ollama_client.py: Write a Python class or functions to make HTTP requests to the Ollama API.
•	b. generate_text Function: A function that takes a prompt and returns the LLM's response.
•	c. Error Handling: Implement try-except blocks to catch connection errors or API response issues.
•	Wisdom & Guidance: Abstracting the LLM interaction into a separate module makes it easy to swap models or providers later.
Part 41 of 72: Develop ai_engine/personalizer.py (Core Logic)
•	a. Retrieve Data for Personalization: Query companies and contacts tables for leads that are 'Not Contacted' and have sufficient data (website, industry, contact name if available).
•	b. Construct Detailed Prompts for LLM: This is the most critical part for personalization. The prompt should include:
o	Role/Persona: "You are an expert sales copywriter..."
o	Goal: "Write a personalized outreach email for [Contact Name] at [Company Name]."
o	Company Context: "Their company, [Company Name], manufactures [Company Industry Details/Products scraped]. Their website is [Website]."
o	Your Product Context: "We specialize in exporting high-quality surgical instruments."
o	Call to Action: "Suggest a clear call to action, e.g., to schedule a brief call."
o	Format: "Provide a subject line and email body."
•	c. Call local_llm.py to Generate Message: Pass the constructed prompt to your ollama_client.
•	Wisdom & Guidance: Prompt engineering is an art. Experiment with different prompt structures to get the best results from your LLM. Be specific!
Part 42 of 72: Generate Multiple Subject Line & Message Variants for A/B Testing
•	a. Modify LLM Prompt: Instruct the LLM to generate 2-3 different subject lines and 2-3 slightly different message body variants for the same outreach.
•	b. Store Variants: When storing in the campaigns table, store each variant and assign an ab_test_group (e.g., 'A', 'B', 'C') for that contact.
•	c. Track message_variant_tested in contacts: Mark which variant a specific contact received.
•	Wisdom & Guidance: A/B testing is how you learn what works. It's iterative.
Part 43 of 72: Develop ai_engine/dynamic_lead_scorer.py
•	a. Define Scoring Factors: Beyond initial relevance, consider factors like:
o	Website quality (presence of specific keywords, clear products).
o	LinkedIn presence (active profile).
o	Country GDP/market size for surgical instruments.
o	Depth of scraped contact info (e.g., having a direct email vs. generic info@).
o	Engagement from previous outreach attempts (if applicable for follow-ups).
•	b. Implement Scoring Logic: A weighted sum or a simple rule-based system. For a "pro" step, consider a very simple machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression) if you have some labeled data (e.g., past leads that converted vs. didn't).
